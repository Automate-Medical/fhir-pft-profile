`referanceRange`
  For pre vs post bronchodilation, we may be able to use "Observation Reference Range Meaning Codes" to better specify which measurement each reference range corresponds to.

  https://www.hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-referencerange-meaning.html#4.3.14.186.2

  >This value set defines a set of codes that can be used to indicate the meaning/use of a reference range for a particular target population.
  >Lvl | Code | Display                        | Definition
  >3   | pre  | Pre Therapeutic Desired Level  | The optimal range for best therapeutic outcomes for a specimen taken immediately before administration.
  >3   | post | Post Therapeutic Desired Level | The optimal range for best therapeutic outcomes for a specimen taken immediately after administration.


LLN/ULN
  I actually think I erred in defining LLN.

  Regarding how to display LLN/ULN, I think maybe we could give a reference range for normal like this:

  ```JSON
  "referenceRange": [
    {
    "low": {
      "value": 3.70,
      "unit": "L",
      "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
      "code": "L"
      },
    },
    "high": {
      "value": 5, // TODO: Placeholder value, not real.
      "unit": "L",
      "system": "http://unitsofmeasure.org",
      "code": "L"
      },
    },
    "type": {
      "text": "normal"
    }
  ]
  ```

  where "low"/"high" are our LLN/ULN, respectively.


Miscellaneous notes:
  In the example PFT, the pulmonologist provided their interpretation of results 4 days after the date of the testing. I think the correct `effectiveDatetime` is the datetime of the pulmonologist's interpretation. And that the datetime of the actual testing will be recorded in the referenced `Encounter`.
